# Project Overview

Welcome to the Voice-Recognition-Software using python.

As of now this program does basic tasks like opening apps, searching google, opening youtube, etc.

## Goal:

This project aims to use smart language understanding to make the program better at talking with you. By using a special technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP), I want the program to understand and respond to a wider range of things you say, making it more helpful and fun to use.

## Key Features:

Talk to the program using your voice.
Understand different things you say with smart speech recognition.
Use fancy language understanding (NLP) to make the program even smarter.
Do cool things like opening apps and following your voice commands.

## Getting Started:

To begin, make sure you have Python 3.x and pip (Python package manager) installed on your computer.
